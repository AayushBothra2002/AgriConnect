## AgriConnect: Streamlining Farm-to-Consumer Connections

AgriConnect is a dynamic e-commerce platform that revolutionizes the way consumers access farm products by directly linking them with over 50 farmers. This connection eliminates intermediary costs and enhances the availability of local produce through sophisticated location-based filtering technology. The platform facilitates an engaging shopping experience for more than 300 consumers by offering:

User-Friendly Features: Personalized user accounts, a real-time catalog with over 100 items, and an intuitive shopping cart system, all designed to increase user engagement and transaction volume.

Secure Transactions: Integration of Stripe for secure payment processing, successfully handling over 500 transactions to date.

Interactive Feedback System: Incorporation of a customer feedback mechanism, developed using a modern tech stack including React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data management.

These features collectively foster a transparent and efficient marketplace that not only benefits consumers with fresh, affordable produce but also empowers farmers by maximizing their profits and market reach.
